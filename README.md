How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, MongoDB

I followed the Model, View, Controller framework. For the model I used Mongoose along with MongoDB to store all of the information. I wrote API's to fetch infromation from MongoDB, used the controllers to render the views. The Views were made with EJS.


Lessons Learned:
I really liked how it all came together, from authentication to writing API's to fetching information and rendering views. This project taught me a lot of things. While it may not be the best looking project, the project represents the wireframe stage, and allowed me to understand how different components worked together.
